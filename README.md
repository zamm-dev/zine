# Zine: ZAMM-flavored Cline

*Zen and the Automation of Metaprogramming for the Masses* is a [home-cooked](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/) version of Cline that is specifically tailored to what [I, Amos,](https://zamm.dev/) want from an AI coding tool. If you are not me, you may find that Zine isn't really for you, and that's okay.

The name is based on [the original ZAMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance).

## Development

You will need to set `LANGWATCH_API_KEY` in your environment variables for [LangWatch telemetry](https://app.langwatch.ai) to work.
